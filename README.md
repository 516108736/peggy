# Peggy

Peggy is a peg zone implementation that allows the movement of tokens and 
potentially other assets from Ethereum (or any EVM) to Cosmos (or any
Tendermint) chain. 

This software is still highly experimental and should not be used in
production.

If you are interested in this, please contact us through an issue :-)

## Unidirectional Peggy

The first draft of the unidirectional system's smart contracts is available in ethereum-contracts and will be leveraged by Cosmos based Relayer and Oracle modules to obtain information about transactions on the Ethereum network.


## Unidirectional Project Specification
The project's specification can be found in the 'README.md' of the `/ethereum-contracts` directory.
